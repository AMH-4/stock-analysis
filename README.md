# **stock-analysis**

## Overview of Project:

*Explore green energy stock perfomance by analyzing financial data using VBA*

#### *Purpose:*

Throughout Module 2 the goal was to help Steve, a Finance graduate, find a way he could quickly analyze an entire dataset at the click of a button. Steve would use this information to advise his clients/parents on the stock market as an investment. The purpose of this challenge is to refactor the Module 2 solution code, so that the VBA script could run faster. A refactored code would enable Steve to analyze a larger data set (the entire stock market) in a more efficient manner.

### *Background:*
Setve, a recent Fiance graduate, was seeking to launch a crowdfunding campaign to for the launch of her play *Fever*. The campaign began  with estimated budget of over $10,000. Nervous about launching a crowdfunding campaign, Louise decided to enlist help. In an effort to determine if there are specific factors that make a campaign successful, I organized, sorted ,and analyzed crowdfunding data. Throughout Module 1 the goal was to help Louise plan her own successful campaign. 


Louise took the analysis I performed throughout Module 1 and was able to execute here own successful crowdfunding campaign for her play *Fever*.


Louiseâ€™s play *Fever* came close to its fundraising goal in short amount of time. 
Upon completing her first crowdfunding campaign, Louise wanted to know how different campaigns faired in relation to their launch dates and their fundraising goal.
