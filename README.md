# **stock-analysis**

## Overview of Project:
*Explore green energy stock perfomance by analyzing financial data using VBA*

#### *Purpose:*
Throughout Module 2 the goal was to help Steve, a Finance graduate, find a way he could quickly analyze an entire dataset at the click of a button. Steve would use this information to advise his clients/parents on the stock market as an investment. The purpose of this challenge is to refactor the Module 2 solution code, so that the VBA script could run faster. A refactored code would enable Steve to analyze a larger data set (the entire stock market) in a more efficient manner.

#### *Background:*

Steve, a Finance graduate, was in search of a way he could quickly analyze an entire dataset of stocks at the click of a button. As he begins his financial advisory practice, his parents became his first clients. Steveâ€™s parents have been seeking to invest in green energy stocks, however they need more information. This project allowed Steve to quickly access 12 green energy stocks and provide a potential diversified portfolio for his parents.
